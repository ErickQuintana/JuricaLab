### Welcome!

### About me

I am a rookie mathematician mainly interested in Arakelov geometry and arithmetic dynamical systems. I am currently a postdoc in BICMR under the supervision of Prof. Xinyi YUAN. I used to stay at Kyoto university from 2018 to 2023, where I earned my PhD with Prof. Atsushi MORIWAKI's mentoring.
