“Human emancipation will only be complete when the real, individual man has adsorbed into himself the abstract citizen; when as individual man, in his everyday life, in his work, and in his relationships, he has become a species-being; and when he has recognized and organized his own powers (forces propres) as social powers so that he no longer separates this social power from himself as political power.” (Marx 46)
